          <strong> Does OPediaHR do payroll? </strong>
          OPediaHR does not directly
          handle payroll. It is an HR management software focused on tasks like
          employee onboarding, performance management, time tracking, and HR
          analytics. However, it may integrate with payroll systems or provide
          features to facilitate payroll processing, such as timekeeping and
          attendance tracking.

          BambooHR pricing varies
          depending on the number of employees and the specific features required
          by the organization. It typically offers a subscription-based model with
          pricing tiers that scale with the size of the company. Additionally,
          BambooHR may offer add-on modules for additional functionality, which
          can affect the overall cost. For specific pricing information, it's best
          to visit BambooHR's website or contact their sales team directly.

          <!-- <strong> Is OPediaHR a PEO?</strong> -->
          No, OPediaHR is not a professional
          employer organization (PEO). It's a human resources management software
          designed to streamline HR processes within organizations. While PEOs
          also offer HR services, they typically handle tasks like payroll,
          benefits administration, and compliance on behalf of client companies,
          acting as co-employers for their employees. OPediaHR focuses more on
          internal HR management rather than outsourcing HR functions to a third
          party like a PEO.
